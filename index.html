      <p>Over this last summer, I decided that I would try programming, specifically in python, to stay productive. I ended up making multiple projects including a to-do list, a number guesser, and a quiz. However, I am going to present the project that I have been working on most recently, a login program. I am still currently working on this project but at the moment(as seen in the picture), you are able to create an account, and login to it. I plan on expanding onto this by adding features to an account and possibly making it an application. </p>

      <p>During Genius Hour, a time where we can learn further on our own topics of interest, I decided to try to learn how to program in Unreal Engine. Unreal Engine is a game development engine that is written in C++. Currently in Unreal Engine, I am working on a game called “Evil Cube,” a game where you have to eliminate the evil cubes before they eliminate you. </p>

      <p>Snap is a visual programming language that is easy to use. As of now, I have made a couple of projects in Snap, one of which is called, “Click Alonzo.” The objective of this game is to click the avatar, also known as Alonzo, as many times as you can. </p>
